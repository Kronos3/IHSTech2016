        <h1 id="ddp">Design and Drawing for Production</h1>
        <p>Design and Drawing for Production is an introductory engineering course for students. The course’s main focus is to teach the application of visualization processes and tools with computer aided design. Also, this course will emphasize the importance of the design process and technical sketching. Additionally, students taking this course can earn college credit from RIT and can receive one fine arts credit, which is vital for graduating at Ithaca High School.</p>
        <h1 id="cim">Computer-Integrated Manufacturing</h1>
        <p>Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, more commonly known as CIM is taken after Design and Drawing for Production. Students learn to use the skills that have already obtained from Design and Drawing for Production and apply them to more complex problems. Also, students learn about the relation between computers and manufacturing, using a CNC router in projects like making coasters. Additionally, the students will evaluate their solutions using mass property analysis and make modifications.</p>
        <h1 id="digital">Digital Electronics</h1>
        <p>This course is mainly about Digital Electronics and studying applied digital logic. In this course, students will study the application of various electronic logic circuits and ways to apply Boolean logic to the solution of problems. Subsequently, students will learn to make prototype circuits that imitate clocks, traffic lights, and more.</p>
        <h1 id="poe">Principles of Engineering</h1>
        <p>Principles of Engineering is a course usually taken along with Digital Electronics. This course is designed to assist students with their understanding about the field of engineering. Students will learn all about engineering and use engineering problem solving skills. The main question students ask themselves is, “Is a career in engineering or engineering technology right for me?”.</p>
        <h1 id="edd">Engineering Design and Development</h1>
        <p>The final course in the PLTW curriculum is Engineering Design and Development or EDD. Throughout the year, everybody enrolled in this course are asked to design a solution for a certain engineering problem. Additionally, students work in teams to solve these problems which encourages teamwork and the application of principles learned in the four previous courses. Many different problems are addressed each year, each one generating an interesting solution.</p>
        <h1 id="graphic">Graphic Communication</h1>
        <p>This course introduces the basics of computer hardware and software.The course’s content includes using Adobe Creative Suite and the numerous programs it comes with such as, Adobe Photoshop, InDesign, and Illustrator.</p>
        <h1 id="architect">Architectural Drawing</h1>
        <p>Architectural Drawing is an introductory course and it allows students to learn to the basics of residential architectural design. Over the course of the year, students will design homes and produce drawings of floor plans and kitchen perspectives.</p>
        <h1 id="printing">Printing Technology</h1>
        <p>Printing Technology is a course that introduces students to materials and equipment that is used to print things. The things students learn to print include, memo pads, stationery business cards, and much more. Because of the high artistic value in the course, it satisfies one half of a student’s required fine arts credit. This attribute also makes the course ideal for people involved with the Tattler (the Ithaca High School newspaper) and the yearbook.</p>
        <h1 id="programming">Programming I and II</h1>
        <p>Programming I and II are both semester long introductory courses typically taken in succession by students with no prior experience with programming.  Students will use programs such as BlueJ and ObjectDraw for programming in Java. Programming I places emphasis on mainly objected-orientated programing. While, Programming II is more difficult, students program previous course works to a greater depth. Additionally, it is also a prerequisite for AP Computer Science.</p>
        <h1 id="compsci">AP Computer Science</h1>
        <p>AP Computer Science is a full year of college level programming. It also requires students to program in Java. Although the course is object-orientated programming, students also learn about inheritance and polymorphism, strings, arrays, and recursions. During May, students will take the AP exam for AP Computer Science which is what the students have been preparing for from the beginning of the year.</p>
