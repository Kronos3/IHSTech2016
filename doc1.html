        <h1>IHS Technology Courses</h1>
        <h2 id="ddp">Design and Drawing for Production</h2>
        <p>Design and Drawing for Production is an introductory engineering course for students. The course’s main focus is to teach the application of visualization processes and tools with computer aided design. Also, this course will emphasize the importance of the design process and technical sketching. Additionally, students taking this course can earn college credit from the Rochester Institute of Technology and can receive one fine arts credit, which is vital for graduating at Ithaca High School. </p>
        <h2 id="cim">Computer-Integrated Manufacturing</h2>
        <p>Computer-Integrated Manufacturing, more commonly known as CIM is taken after Design and Drawing for Production. Students learn to use the skills that have already obtained from Design and Drawing for Production and apply them to more complex problems. Also, students learn about the relation between computers and manufacturing, using a CNC router in projects like making coasters. Additionally, the students will evaluate their solutions using mass property analysis and make modifications.</p>
        <h2 id="digital">Digital Electronics</h2>
        <p>This course is mainly about Digital Electronics and studying applied digital logic. In this course, students will study the application of various electronic logic circuits and ways to apply Boolean logic to the solution of problems. Subsequently, students will learn to make prototype circuits that imitate clocks, traffic lights, and more.</p>
        <h2 id="poe">Principles of Engineering</h2>
        <p>Principles of Engineering is a course usually taken along with Digital Electronics. This course is designed to assist students with their understanding about the field of engineering. Students will learn all about engineering and use engineering problem solving skills. The main question students ask themselves is, “Is a career in engineering or engineering technology right for me?”.</p>
        <h2 id="edd">Engineering Design and Development</h2>
        <p>The final course in the PLTW curriculum is Engineering Design and Development or EDD. By far the most compelling STEM projects done at Ithaca High School happen in the Engineering Design and Development course, where students begin the year working in teams to build a boat from cardboard and one roll of duct tape to sail across the school’s pool. Most teams make it across. But the real fun starts later: teams of students come up with proposals for something to build throughout the year. At a banquet attended by the Ithaca City School District Superintendent Luvelle Brown, technology teachers, and representatives from nearby Cornell University, Ithaca College, and the Tompkins Cortland Community College, the teams present their ideas in an attempt to garner a fraction of the $2,000 alloted to the class. Having gotten funding, they begin work on their project.</p>
        <img class="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Kronos3/IHSTech2016/gh-pages/images/boat.png">
        <p>Ithaca High School Technology Student Association president Zak Stillman’s team is working on a controller for new electric motors they want to install in Ithaca High School’s small Electrathon car. They want to replace the current brushless motor with a brushed one, but not pay the prohibitive cost of brushed motor controllers. This means building three circuit boards.</p>
        <p>Other groups are converting a VW Buggy to run on propane, designing a device to be placed in a stream to generate electricity for hikers, creating a glove that will reduce sweat while gaming, and another is designing an app that can play many different card and board games in the app.</p>
        <h2 id="apchem">AP Chemistry</h2>
        <p>A look around the AP Chemistry classroom reveals many things of interest: a reaction that transfers water from one beaker to another through the air sits inconspicuously on the counter. Most of the available space is filled with glassware—burettes, beakers, volumetric flasks, graduated cylinders, and the like. The room reeks of chemistry—and this is often not figurative language. Students prepare for the AP exam, learning about atoms and molecules and bonding, the behavior of gases, equilibrium, acid-base reactions, and more. Taught by Mr. Tuori—known for his affable and compelling strangeness—the class is a true joy.</p>
        <h2 id="printing">Printing Technology</h2>
        <p>Printing Technology is a course that introduces students to materials and equipment that is used to print things. The things students learn to print include memo pads, stationery business cards, and much more. Because of the high artistic value in the course, it satisfies one half of a student’s required fine arts credit. This attribute also makes the course ideal for people involved with <i>The Tattler</i> (the Ithaca High School newspaper) and the yearbook.</p>
        <h2 id="programming">Programming I and II</h2>
        <p>Programming I and II are both semester long introductory courses typically taken in succession by students with no prior experience with programming.  Students will use programs such as BlueJ and ObjectDraw for programming in Java. Programming I places emphasis on mainly objected-orientated programing, covering important parts of Java: loops, if-then statements, the general syntax, ArrayLists, and arrays. While, Programming II is more difficult, students program previous course works to a greater depth. Additionally, it is also a prerequisite for AP Computer Science. </p>
        <h2 id="compsci">AP Computer Science</h2>
        <p>AP Computer Science is a full year of college level programming. It also requires students to program in Java. Although the course is object-orientated programming, students also learn about inheritance and polymorphism, strings, arrays, and recursions. During May, students will take the AP exam for AP Computer Science which is what the students have been preparing for from the beginning of the year.</p>
        <h2 id="calculus">AP Calculus BC</h2>
        <p>This course encapsulates everything learned in a full year of college calculus, dealing with derivatives, integrals, and their applications. Students complete fun projects like finding equations that model the thrill produced by going on a particular roller coaster, or designing a buoy that floats exactly so many inches out of the water.</p>
