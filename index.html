        <h1>Culture of STEM</h1>
        <p>Ithaca High School is a great place to be not just for its teachers, classes, and workspaces, but also for its dedicated STEM culture, held by the perhaps 150 students who make up the local TSA chapter, Code Red Robotics Club, Science Olympiad, Dev Team, and Chemistry Club. It is a place where going through the complex technical steps to hack your supposedly unhackable Chromebook or find flaws in the school’s security software—provided you don’t do any harm—is a badge of honor within our technology community.</p>
        <p>This community is composed of people who would fit into an engineering program, but not as often at prom. We are computer and math and chemistry geeks, but there are enough of us; we are not uncool. We’re either so immersed in the joy of STEM or we see it as a compelling means to making the world a better place.</p>
        <p>When Cornell University—just uphill from IHS—hosted a twenty-four hour Makeathon  (like a hackathon, but not strictly limited to computers) a six student team from IHS including three TSA members showed up because it would be fun. They won with what they call P!LLPAL, an ambitious and innovative innovation on current automated pill dispensers. According to their presentation, it could save millions of lives lost due to people forgetting to take medicinal pills. With luck, the team will be able to continue P!LLPAL into something more than the product of a twenty-four hour all-nighter. According to one of the team’s members:</p>
        <p class="quote">“We all got to mess around with technology and prototype something cool.”</p>
        <p>It may sound corny or bland, but we could tell it was heartfelt. Anyone who would fit in at MIT or CalTech—but is a few years too young—would match Ithaca High School’s community very well.</p>
